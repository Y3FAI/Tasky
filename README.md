# Tasky

**Local-first todo app for recurring tasks.**

Most todo apps fail at two things: custom repetition and reliable alerts. Tasky solves this by building a dedicated scheduling engine rather than relying on standard system alarms.

### Functionality

* **Complex Recurrence:** Schedule tasks for specific patterns (e.g., "Every Monday and Wednesday") rather than just daily/weekly loops.
* **Notification Diagnostics:** A built-in debugger that checks if your phone's battery settings or permissions are silently blocking your reminders.
* **Offline Architecture:** 100% local SQLite database. No servers, no accounts, no latency.
* **Minimal Design:** Clean design without annoying features or login pop-ups.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run android

```
